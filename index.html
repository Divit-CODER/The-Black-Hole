            <p>black hole, cosmic body of extremely intense gravity from which nothing, not even light, can escape. A black hole can be formed by the death of a massive star. When such a star has exhausted the internal thermonuclear fuels in its core at the end of its life, the core becomes unstable and gravitationally collapses inward upon itself, and the starâ€™s outer layers are blown away. The crushing weight of constituent matter falling in from all sides compresses the dying star to a point of zero volume and infinite density called the singularity.</p>

            <p>Black holes can allow the Time Travel to the future: their immense gravity slows time (this effect increases with proximity). A few minutes or hours may pass for the user near the event horizon, and when they leave, they may find it's hundreds of years in the future</p>

<h1> The place where the black hole is located</h1>
        <div class="line"></div>
            <p>The supermassive black hole is located at the heart of a galaxy called M87, located about 55 million light-years away, and weighs more than 6 billion solar masses. Its event horizon extends so far it could encompass much of our solar system out to well beyond the planets</p>
